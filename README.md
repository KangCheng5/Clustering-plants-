# Clustering-plants-

 I found this dataset at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/180/plants. It is a plants vs their found
 locations record. There are over 34k rows and 70 columns. The data was not initially organized
 for use right away. Some transformation has to be done at the begining.
 
 Data has been extracted from the USDA plants database. It contains all plants (species and
 genera) in the database and the states of USA and Canada where they occur. The data is in the
 transactional form. It contains the Latin names (species or genus) and state abbreviations.

 The notebook started with reading the data, transform the data, cleaning the data, followed by EDA which 
 includes 3 visualizations and 3 unsupervised models.
